# Unit Test Generation for Country Weather Search: Data Flow and API Interaction

## Objective:
Generate comprehensive unit tests for the data processing aspects of the "Search Country Weather" feature. The tests should rigorously cover data input validation, API request formation, API response parsing and validation, and error handling related to data. UI-level tests are out of scope.

## Feature Description:
The "Search Country Weather" feature accepts a country identifier (name or code), validates this input, queries an external weather API, validates the structure and content of the API's response, and then processes this data or handles any errors encountered during these steps.

## Areas to Test (Focus: Data Input & API Data Output):

### 1. Input Data Validation:
  - **Test Case 1.1: Valid Country Name (Standard)**
    - Input: `"United States"`
    - Expected: Input is valid. Data proceeds to API call preparation.
  - **Test Case 1.2: Valid Country Name (with spaces, to be trimmed)**
    - Input: `"  Canada  "`
    - Expected: Input is trimmed to `"Canada"`, validated as such.
  - **Test Case 1.3: Valid Country Code (if supported)**
    - Input: `"DE"` (for Germany)
    - Expected: Input is recognized as a valid country code.
  - **Test Case 1.4: Empty String Input**
    - Input: `""`
    - Expected: Input validation error (e.g., "Country name/code cannot be empty"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.5: Null Input**
    - Input: `null`
    - Expected: Input validation error (e.g., "Country name/code cannot be null"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.6: Input with Only Spaces**
    - Input: `"   "`
    - Expected: Input validation error after trimming (e.g., "Country name/code cannot be empty"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.7: Input Exceeding Max Length (if applicable)**
    - Input: A string longer than the defined maximum length.
    - Expected: Input validation error (e.g., "Input exceeds maximum length"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.8: Input with Disallowed Special Characters**
    - Input: `"Germany@#!"`
    - Expected: Input validation error (e.g., "Invalid characters in input"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.9: Numeric Input (if only alphabetic names/codes are allowed)**
    - Input: `"12345"`
    - Expected: Input validation error (e.g., "Invalid format for country name/code"). No API call.
  - **Test Case 1.10: Mixed Case Input Normalization**
    - Input: `"jaPAn"`
    - Expected: Input is normalized (e.g., to "Japan" or "JAPAN") before further processing or API call.

### 2. API Interaction and Response Data Validation (Mocking the API is essential):

  - **Test Case 2.1: Successful API Response - Complete and Valid Data**
    - Input: `"France"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{ "country": "France", "temperature": 22, "unit": "Celsius", "condition": "Sunny", "humidity": 55, "wind_speed": 10, "last_updated": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z" }`
    - Expected: System correctly parses all fields, validates data types (e.g., temperature is number, condition is string), and transforms into the application's internal weather data model.
  - **Test Case 2.2: API Response - Country Not Found (e.g., 404)**
    - Input: `"NonExistentCountry"`
    - Mocked API Response (404 Not Found): `{ "error": "Country not found" }` or empty body.
    - Expected: System correctly interprets the 404 error and reports "country not found" or equivalent. No data processing attempts on weather fields.
  - **Test Case 2.3: API Response - Data Structure with Missing Required Fields**
    - Input: `"Germany"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{ "country": "Germany", "condition": "Cloudy" }` (missing `temperature`)
    - Expected: System detects missing required field (`temperature`), logs the issue, and handles the error gracefully (e.g., returns a partial data error or specific error message).
  - **Test Case 2.4: API Response - Data with Incorrect Data Types**
    - Input: `"UK"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{ "country": "UK", "temperature": "15", "condition": "Rain" }` (`temperature` is string instead of number)
    - Expected: System detects data type mismatch, attempts conversion if robust, or flags as an error.
  - **Test Case 2.5: API Response - Malformed JSON**
    - Input: `"Italy"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `"{ \"country\": \"Italy\", \"temperature\": 20, ...` (incomplete JSON)
    - Expected: System fails to parse JSON, logs the error, and reports a data retrieval error.
  - **Test Case 2.6: API Response - Empty but Valid JSON Object**
    - Input: `"Spain"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{}`
    - Expected: System handles this as "no data available" or a specific error, rather than crashing.
  - **Test Case 2.7: API Response - Null Values for Expected Fields**
    - Input: `"Portugal"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{ "country": "Portugal", "temperature": null, "condition": "Foggy" }`
    - Expected: System handles `null` gracefully (e.g., represents as "N/A", omits the field, or uses a default).
  - **Test Case 2.8: API Response - Unexpected Extra Fields**
    - Input: `"Netherlands"`
    - Mocked API Response (200 OK): `{ "country": "Netherlands", "temperature": 18, "condition": "Windy", "extra_field": "some_value" }`
    - Expected: System successfully parses known fields and ignores `extra_field` without error.
  - **Test Case 2.9: API Server Error (500, 503)**
    - Input: `"Sweden"`
    - Mocked API Response: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error or 503 Service Unavailable.
    - Expected: System handles server-side API error gracefully, reports a generic API error.
  - **Test Case 2.10: API Authentication/Authorization Error (401, 403)**
    - Input: `"Norway"`
    - Mocked API Response: HTTP 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden.
    - Expected: System handles auth error, potentially logs "API key invalid" or similar.
  - **Test Case 2.11: API Rate Limiting (429)**
    - Input: `"Denmark"`
    - Mocked API Response: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.
    - Expected: System handles rate limiting error, perhaps suggests retrying later.
  - **Test Case 2.12: API Timeout**
    - Input: `"Finland"`
    - Mocked API Behavior: Simulate a network timeout during the API call.
    - Expected: System handles the timeout error gracefully.

### 3. Data Transformation and Output (Post-API Call):
  - **Test Case 3.1: Correct Transformation to Internal Model**
    - Input: `"Australia"`
    - Mocked API Response: Valid, complete data for Australia.
    - Expected: The raw API data is correctly transformed into the application's defined internal `WeatherInfo` object/structure, with all fields mapped and typed correctly.
  - **Test Case 3.2: Handling of Units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion if required)**
    - Input: `"Canada"` (assuming API returns Celsius, app displays Fahrenheit)
    - Mocked API Response: `{ "temperature": 0, "unit": "Celsius", ... }`
    - Expected: Output data shows temperature as 32 (Fahrenheit), or the unit is correctly stored/displayed.
  - **Test Case 3.3: Date/Time Field Parsing and Formatting**
    - Input: `"New Zealand"`
    - Mocked API Response: `{ "last_updated": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z", ... }`
    - Expected: The `last_updated` string is parsed into a valid Date object or formatted correctly for internal use/display.

## Instructions for the AI:
Based on the feature description and the detailed test cases above:
1.  Identify the primary class/module/function(s) responsible for:
   *   Input validation.
   *   Calling the external weather API.
   *   Parsing and validating the API response.
   *   Transforming API data into an internal application model.
2.  For each test case scenario described:
   *   Suggest a descriptive test method name (e.g., `test_inputValidation_emptyString_shouldReturnError`).
   *   Specify the necessary setup, including detailed mocking configurations for the API client/service. This should cover return values, error throwing, and status codes.
   *   Define the precise input values for the function under test.
   *   State the exact expected outcome:
      *   For validation errors: the type of error or error message.
      *   For successful data processing: the structure and values of the processed data.
      *   For API errors: how the error is handled and reported by the system.
3.  Generate unit test code in **Angular (TypeScript using Jasmine/Karma)**. The generated tests should operate on existing data models (e.g., the `WeatherInfo` model mentioned in Test Case 3.1) and services defined within the project. Do not introduce new data model definitions (interfaces/classes) or create new mock components within the test suites; assume necessary models and types are imported from the project's actual source code. Ensure tests are self-contained and mock all external dependencies, especially `HttpClient`.
4.  Ensure tests are isolated and can run independently.
5.  Focus strictly on testing the data handling logic. Do not generate tests for UI components or DOM interaction.
6.  After generating the tests, include a conceptual step:
   "**Simulated Test Execution and Debugging:**
   Assume `ng test --watch=false --code-coverage` (or a similar command for the testing setup) is executed.
   If the terminal output indicates test failures (e.g., assertion errors, compilation errors in tests, runtime errors in tests):
   1.  Analyze the error messages provided in the terminal.
   2.  Identify the root cause (e.g., incorrect mock setup, wrong assertion, flaw in the test logic, or an actual bug in the source code being tested).
   3.  Propose specific code changes to the generated unit tests (or, if necessary, to the hypothetical source code) to fix these errors and make the tests pass."
